  "about": "*Built with love by the Applicaster Owned Plugins Team* \n**Supports:** *Android, iOS* \n*Current Version: 6.1.1 * \n**About** \nIntegrated into Google's dominant digital ecosystem, Google Analytics for Firebase (previously just known just as \"Firebase Analytics\") provides a free, broad, and effective tool for mobile analytics. \nOne of two analytics solutions recommended by Applicaster as part of your plugin default starter pack (the other being Facebook Analytics), GA for Firebase is the fastest growing analytics SDK in mobile apps, and for good reason. They offer behavioral analysis, user navigation tracking, Google-generated demographic data, acquisition data, and more to help you make more informed business decisions on how to manage your app. \n[Click Here](https://firebase.google.com/products/analytics/) to learn more. \nIn order to use Google Analytics for Firebase, the broader Firebase platform must be configured. [Click Here](https://applicaster.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004662546-Firebase-Configuration) to learn learn how to do so. \n**Key Features:** \n* Behavioral Analytics - A strong set of [automatic events](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/6317485?hl=en) complemented by Applicaster's own broad and deep [custom events](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hlp2sAm9lsKR3x__pk-dD-oCVBO3vJItjnQlrNwB_NM/edit?usp=sharing) gives you a ton of insight into behavior in your app. Can segment by an array of parameters, create user groups based on behavior, and set certain activity up as conversion events to optimize for. \n* Navigation Tracking - Powerful funnel analysis and robust screen tracking enables you to understand the navigation patterns in your app in order to better capitalize on the dynamic configurability of our UI Builder \n* Broad Integrations - Fully baked into the Google and Firebase ecosystem, you can capitalize on revenue data from the Google Play Store, track the effectiveness of app marketing campaigns via Google Ads and several other acquisition channels, and dump data directly into BigQuery, and more. \n* Audience Centric - Capitalizing on Google's enormous data capture and modeling, Firebase enables you to get a strong sense of your users' demographics and interests and even slice behavioral data by this information. \n* No data limit on events - As opposed to the traditional Google Analytics platform, there are no data limits on how many events you can send and the platform never resorts to sampling. \n* User Data - Enrich your audience analysis by delivering any non-PII (Personally Identifiable Information) user data to the platform, creating user groups based on that information, and segmenting any other analytics feature (e.g. actions, funnels, retention) by these user groups \n**Pricing** \nGoogle Analytics for Firebase is completely free. \n**Potential Future Features Include:** \n* Firebase Notifications \n* A/B Testing"
